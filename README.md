comic.js
=======

Javascript library that acts as plugin for [Raphael.js](http://http//raphaeljs.com/), [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), [SVG.js](http://svgjs.com/) and provides functions for cartoon style SVG drawing. Currently it supports only SVG (no canvas), but if someone needs canvas support I might implement it (let me know).

Credits:
Inspired by and based on [Jonas Wagner's work](http://29a.ch/2010/2/10/hand-drawn-lines-algorithm-javascript-canvas-html5)
which is based on this [paper](http://iwi.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2008/ProcCAGVIMeraj/2008ProcCAGVIMeraj.pdf)

Usage
-----
Simply include `comic.min.js` after including one of the support libraries
